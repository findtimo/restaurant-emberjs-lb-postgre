 * from/to. When we malloc we pass out a VMHandle, which
 * is used as an indirect way of accessing the memory during
 * execution of the VM. Internally we track the different
 * regions of the memory in an int array known as the table.
 *
 * The table 32-bit aligned and has the following layout:
 *
 * | ... | hp (u32) |       info (u32)   | size (u32) |
 * | ... |  Handle  | Scope Size | State | Size       |
 * | ... | 32bits   | 30bits     | 2bits | 32bit      |
 *
 * With this information we effectively have the ability to
 * control when we want to free memory. That being said you
 * can not free during execution as raw address are only
 * valid during the execution. This means you cannot close
 * over them as you will have a bad memory access exception.
